# 7Days to Waffle: Quick start Guide

This is a quick guide on how you can prepare your pc for connecting to the server.

> **Hint:** This guide will often ask you to locate your 7 days to die folder, if you cannot find this, go to the steam app, locate "7 Days to die" in the left colomn of games and right click it. You will see `Manage` > `Browse local files` this will open the root folder of the game ü¶Ñ !

### Step 1:
Download the mods, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5tL6V895bEqeKyI-oYdJbybblvdDObB/view?usp=share_link) <br/>
Download the Prefabs, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SdStOjNf1wbrtmmBKAWgfpsCBc7Z7gDn/view?usp=share_link)

### Step 2:
Extract the `Mods` archive folder into the root of the game folder, see picture below for example: <br/>*(if you cannot find the game folder, see the game files hint at the top of this readme)*

### Step 3: 
Extract the `Prefabs` archive folder into the `root\data` folder of your game. Replace everything in the folder if anything already exists, but do **NOT** delete the folder before copying. See picture below for example:

### Step 4:
Make sure you have the same version running as the server. The server is running on 20.6 Stable. If you have a different version:
<br/>
Go to 7 Days to die in steam, on the left side in the game colomn, right click the game and go to properties. Here you will find `Betas` > `Select the beta you would like to opt into:` Select `alpha20.6 - Alpha 20.6 Stable`. See picture below for example:

### Step 5
Ayyyy, you're at the final step! Gametime soon!!! <br/>
For the final step, simply click in steam play the game, which should give you a popup that asks you to either `Play 7 Days to Die` or `Show game launcher`, select show the game launcher.<br/>
Normally you just need to uncheck `Use GameSparks` & `Use EasyAntiCheat (EAC)`, but if you have any issues follow the settings from the example below:

### Playtime!!!
**Final Notice:** If you have any issues with errors before joining the world, make sure the following is true:
- Mods are extracted in the root folder of your game, NOT in the data folder.
- Prefabs are extracted in the root/data folder of your game, NOT in the root folder.

If you still had an old installation of the game and it seems to not work with this server, sometimes the game is buggy, then do the following:

- In the 7 Days to die Game launcher, there is a tab called tools, click the option `Clean game data...` and select all checkboxes in the next screen. <br/> **If you wish to keep your save files, make sure to back those up first!!** (Save files located @ `%APPDATA%\Roaming\7Daystodie\saves`)
- Then go to steam -> verify integrity game files
- Then place your saves back (or test first)
- Make sure to do **Step 5** again!! (clean game data has cleared this)
- Make sure in the main menu of the game you have the same version as the server (see **Step 4**)
- Then try to connect again, if it still doesn't work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÖ
